Show employers that you have the foundational skills required for your next job or promotion.

Linux adoption continues to rise world-wide as individual users, government entities and industries ranging from automotive to space exploration embrace open source technologies. This expansion of open source in enterprise is redefining traditional Information and Communication Technology (ICT) job roles to require more Linux skills. Whether youâ€™re starting your career in open source, or looking for advancement, independently verifying your skill set can help you stand out to hiring managers or your management team.

The Linux Essentials Professional Development Certificate (PDC) also serves as an ideal stepping-stone to the more advanced LPIC Professional Certification track for Linux Systems Administrators.
